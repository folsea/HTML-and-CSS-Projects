Projects  

Red Fire Family is a basic website create to support my son in an effort of Building himself in to a brand. It includes a few photos from use spending quality time together to help others that are less fortunate. It also includes a membership form for visitor to input their information so he can send out newsletters and update or event he may decide to set up invite his fans too.   

 

The One-page Website  

Focuses on the goofier and caring side of Firebug BB mostly it consists of picture related to his game, this includes the picture ability to expand slightly, and some fun fonts. To show it is not always fun and game we embedded a video from one of his volunteer days.  

 

Final HTML  

 Is much more of an information page with page bookmarks, will eventually be connected to other pages also. It also shows an overlay over Mama Roze avatar, and a table of other family member nick names and avatars.
